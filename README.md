## Approach Used  

### **1. Data Wrangling**  
In this phase, the dataset is assessed for missing values, and necessary data-cleaning techniques are applied.  
- Create a structured database and import the dataset.  
- Ensure all fields have `NOT NULL` constraints to prevent missing values.  

### **2. Feature Engineering**  
New columns are generated to enhance data analysis and uncover trends.  
- **`time_of_day`**: Categorizes transactions into **Morning, Afternoon, and Evening** to determine peak sales periods.  
- **`day_name`**: Extracts the day of the week (**Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri**) to identify the busiest days.  
- **`month_name`**: Extracts the month (**Jan, Feb, Mar**) to track revenue and profit trends over time.  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
EDA is conducted to generate insights, answer business-related questions, and uncover sales trends.
